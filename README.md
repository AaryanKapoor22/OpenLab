# OpenLabScheduling for Quinnipiac University Nursing School

## Project Overview

This OpenLab Scheduler application is designed for the Nursing School of Quinnipiac University. It facilitates efficient scheduling and management of lab sessions. Students can register for open and missed labs, while professors can manage student absences and add new labs.

### Features

- **Student Scheduling**: Enables students to find and register for available lab sessions, ensuring they complete their required practical hours.
- **Professor Management**: Allows faculty to manage lab sessions and student attendance effectively.
- **Dynamic Lab Addition**: Professors can add new lab sessions as needed to adapt to changing curriculum demands.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally. The setup is divided into two main parts: setting up the backend **AND THEN** the frontend.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have npm installed on your system. npm is a package manager for Node.js that can be downloaded from [Node.js's official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaryanKapoor22/OpenLab.git
cd OpenLab
cd Backend
npm install
npm start
Then continue to the frontend -->
cd ../Frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend should now be running and accessible through http://localhost:3001, and the backend will be servicing requests from the frontend.
